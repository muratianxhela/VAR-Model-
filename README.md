# VAR-Model-Estimation
# In this project I decided to create a model using JAPAN capital flows. In this case the JAPAN capital finacial account is represented as a function of JAPAN moneyy and US interest rate as well as GDP in both countries. After pulling data directly from FRED and creating variables for our dataset, we estimate a model of Japan capital flows. In this project we are going to use Granger Causality tests, orthogonalized Impulse Response Functions, and Forecast Error Variance Decompositions to  show the impact of income and monetary variable. In clonclusion we can say that JAPAN capital finacial account is mostly affected by US intreset rate Japan money.
